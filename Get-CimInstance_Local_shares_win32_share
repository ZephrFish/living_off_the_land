You can use the "Get-CimInstance" cmdlet with the "Win32_Share" class to retrieve information about the shared resources on a computer. Here's an example command to list all the shares on the local computer:

PS C:\Users\User1> Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_Share

Name   Path                        Description
----   ----                        -----------
ADMIN$ C:\Windows                  Remote Admin
C$     C:\                         Default share
IPC$                               Remote IPC
Test   C:\Users\User1\Desktop\Test
Users  C:\Users
Work   C:\Shares\Work
Work2  C:\Shares\Work

This command retrieves information about all the shared resources on the local computer, including information such as the name of the share, the path of the shared folder, the description of the share, and the type of share (e.g. disk, printer, IPC).
You can also use the "-Filter" parameter to filter the results to show only shares that meet specific criteria. For example, to show only the shares that are currently in use, you can use the following command:

PS C:\Users\User1> Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_Share -Filter "Type='0'"

Name  Path                        Description
----  ----                        -----------
Test  C:\Users\User1\Desktop\Test
Users C:\Users
Work  C:\Shares\Work
Work2 C:\Shares\Work

This command retrieves information about all the disk shares that are currently in use on the local computer. The "Type" property of the "Win32_Share" class indicates the type of share, and a value of "0" represents a disk share.

You can also use the "Select-Object" cmdlet to display specific properties of the shared resources. For example, to display only the names and paths of the shared folders, you can use the following command:

PS C:\Users\User1> Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_Share | Select-Object Name, Path

Name   Path
----   ----
ADMIN$ C:\Windows
C$     C:\
IPC$
Test   C:\Users\User1\Desktop\Test
Users  C:\Users
Work   C:\Shares\Work
Work2  C:\Shares\Work
To see if WINRM is enabled on a remote host
