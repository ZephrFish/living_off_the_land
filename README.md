# living_off_the_land

I play in my own active directory lab a lot. I love being able to execute something and see the results instantly, this approach has enabled me to discover loads of techniques.

I wanted to share some of these results and as such will document some of these findings.

These should be considered experimental and the results are highly likely to differ depending on the testing environment.

All these shared samples were created by me, using tooling built into the Windows operating system, they have have also been executed under the context of an account that only belongs to the domain user group (standard user).




Build your own AD lab

I strongly encourage that all infrastructure testers including Red / Purple / Blue Team members should build their own active directory lab, which consists of at least one Windows server, and two Windows 10 / 11 hosts.

For more information on how I build my lab please see https://github.com/myexploit/LAB/blob/master/Hack_Lab_Domain which documents setting up the test domain that I use.
